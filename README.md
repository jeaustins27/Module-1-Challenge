## Lessons Learned

With this project I learned the process and importance of refactoring. I learned the importance of consilidating code within your stylesheet to ensure that there aren't too many lines of code. I also learned the importance of using semantic HTML elements to make the website more accessible. There was a lot of strategic thinking involved to group many different lines of code together in the stylesheet, but with patience it all began to flow naturally. By the end of the project I felt like I had gained great knowledge within HTML and CSS to ensure the code written is neat and flows properly.
